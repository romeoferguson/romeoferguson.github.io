<h2>Power Pallet Trucks Key Biscayne </h2>
<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>As long as the needs of your business fit the abilities and the strengths of the forklift, both the electric forklift and electric reach stacker can be extremely beneficial to your company. Suspension Lift Kit: If money's not an object and you want to go all out for a kit that lifts both your body and suspension for maximum off-road capabilities, a suspension lift kit is the way to go.</p>

There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>When lifting a load, a reach truck moves the load back within the wheelbase, meaning less of the load is protruding from the reach truck.
