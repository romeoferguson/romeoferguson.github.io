The counterbalanced, fuel-driven forklift is suited for outdoor use. Internal combustion (IC) forklifts are powered by a traditional engine that runs on one of several types of fuel: compressed gasses or diesel.</p>
<p>Both Gasoline engine type and LP gas engine type have stronger power, hence suitable for heavy goods cargo work, while Electric and fuel cell types have zero emission and great quietness, which are more suitable for in-warehouse work. Weight of vehicle (and operator) behind the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and weight of vehicle beyond front wheels); front wheels act as fulcrum or pivot point.</p>
