<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>Ohio Power Tool carries a wide selection of jack stands (truck air jack stands, vehicle support jack stands, forklift jack stands, pin-type jack stands, and truck ramps) that offer capacities of 3-25 tons. Unlike most car repairs or upgrades, lifting a truck requires a little more effort than getting a few gearhead friends together on a Sunday afternoon to gather around a toolbox and a twelve-pack.</p>
<h2>Fork Lifting Training Ocala</h2>

<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>This allows the reach truck to place pallets of products into shelving. All forklift operators should be certified and keep their training up to date, for their safety and that of those around them.
