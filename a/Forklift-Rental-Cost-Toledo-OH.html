And there is a good reason for that: they are extremely well adapted to the confines and materials handling needs of the department store. These lift trucks are designed to maximize unit load capacity by narrowing aisles and promoting product throughput.</p>
<h2>Hand Pallet Toledo</h2>
<p>These lift trucks are meant to operate in narrow aisles and are best for storing and retrieving pallets in racks. The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet. These kinds of lift kits are popular because no work is necessary to adjust the suspension or other mechanical systems on the truck. These forklifts feature a simple, cost-effective Tier 4 Final solution.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>United Rentals was founded in 1997 and is the largest equipment rental company in the world. Items such as computers, drums, corrugated boxes, plastic bottles, furniture and beverages are examples of products which are stacked onto pallets and moved by reach trucks. Crown also introduced a number of technology enhancements to improve forklift safety. At ProMat 2019 in booth #S3603, attendees can view the brand-new Yale® robotic reach truck, an industry-first dual-mode pantograph robotic lift truck capable of autonomously depositing and retrieving loads from locations as high as 30 feet and reaching into double-deep storage.</p>
<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>
