<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.

As with any other vehicle, trucks make statements. Braking applied with the handle in an upright and horizontal position, increases the safety of the truck while a built-in pressure relief valve protects the electric reach stacker from overloads, increasing the reliability.</p>
