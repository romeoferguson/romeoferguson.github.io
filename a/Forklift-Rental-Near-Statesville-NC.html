<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model.

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>Most rough terrain forklifts have ergonomic controls for easy, intuitive use. The warehouse forklift has two subtypes: the side loader and the counterbalance forklift. Since the 1960s, Caterpillar has been producing forklift trucks designed to last, and built to perform in some of the toughest and harshest environments in the world.

It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
