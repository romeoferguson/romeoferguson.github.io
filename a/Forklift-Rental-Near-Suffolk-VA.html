Also called a pump truck, a pallet jack is smaller in size than the above mentioned forklifts.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.
