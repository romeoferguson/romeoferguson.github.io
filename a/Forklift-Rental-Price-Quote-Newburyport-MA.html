Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels. The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>

Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks.

The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>

Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are the forklifts that do most of the materials handling work in industrial facilities today.
