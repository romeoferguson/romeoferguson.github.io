With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>
<p>The following particularly applies to pallet trucks with a platform: Many ergonomic elements and functions make it easier to operate the truck. Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts. If you are unsure of what you want in a car, you need to create a shortlist of the trucks that appeal to you.</p>

We are one leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India. Extreme Weather: Since rough terrain forklifts come equipped with high-traction tires, they can tackle all kinds of weather conditions. The Apex features a 6 inch off road suspension, custom wheels, and all-terrain tires.</p>
