<h2>Lift Truck Safety South Point</h2>

<p>If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
<p>This mainly due to the growing demand for material handling equipment across the manufacturing industry. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations. Regardless of whether you are looking for routine lifted truck maintenance or extensive collision repair, we've got you covered at Laura Buick GMC. There has been talk of making DOT crash bars mandatory on all lifted vehicles, to help eliminate stock-height vehicles from continuing underneath a lifted vehicle.</p>

Our powered pallet trucks are easy to manoeuvre with load capacities up to 3t, perfect for material handling operations. Operating a rough terrain forklift exposes you to many hazards.</p>
