This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>In addition, while reach trucks can be used at heights up to 40ft, this position places physical strain upon the operator's neck and eyes and so it not a recommended height for frequent use. Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle. Additionally, the report enlists several leading companies that have generated substantial Forklift Trucks Market revenue in recent years and forecasts the companies that are likely to emerge leading in the coming years.</p>

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
