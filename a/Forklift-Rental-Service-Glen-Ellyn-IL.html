<p>Class VI - Class VI trucks are tractors with either electric of internal combustion engines. Narrow Aisle Forklifts : Use: Primarily used indoors on smooth surfaces where space is a premium.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
