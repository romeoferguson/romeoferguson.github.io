<p>Driving with the load downhill can result in loss of the load and control of the forklift. Efficient, versatile and productive, Raymond Counterbalanced Lift Trucks perform at the highest levels.

Battery-operated reach trucks are gaining popularity among end use industries, owing to their ability to handle double pallet and horizontal transport.</p>

Braking applied with the handle in an upright and horizontal position, increases the safety of the truck while a built-in pressure relief valve protects the electric reach stacker from overloads, increasing the reliability.</p>
