<p>3300-4500 mm Duplex or Triplex clear-view mast options available, to give you flexibility in customising your forklift for the job at hand. Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<h2>PIG Poly Deck With Pallet Jack Pockets Mulvane </h2>
<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the high-level order picker when stopping and starting from the highest lift heights. Forklifts are commonly used in warehousing, storeroom, supply chain, and distribution environments.

We carry a huge selection of lift trucks and forklifts for rent to provide a fit no matter the size or scope of your application. Now you've seen how a forklift's center of gravity can shift. So, the operator can drive straight in the aisle and turn the mast at a 90-degree angle to access the material.</p>
<p>United Rentals was founded in 1997 and is the largest equipment rental company in the world. Items such as computers, drums, corrugated boxes, plastic bottles, furniture and beverages are examples of products which are stacked onto pallets and moved by reach trucks.

<p>Ideal for use in warehouses with vertical racking, Electric order pickers are available in either ride-on or walk-behind units. The type of tires you choose for your forklift greatly depends on the type of forklift you purchase and the driving environment.
