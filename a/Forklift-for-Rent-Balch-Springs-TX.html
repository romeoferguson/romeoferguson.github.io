<p>Suspension lifts are also found on a number of high performance sports cars, in which a very low ground clearance is used to improve handling, using an aerodynamic effect known as downforce; examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Huracan, McLaren 720S, and the second generation Ford GT.

Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>

Capacity requirements can arise without notice, so a forklift rental can help an operation stay nimble and responsive to changing business conditions.
