This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
<p>Easy to programme and fully configurable, the BT Reflex N-series reach trucks are also suitable for cold store applications. A. Rise in infrastructure projects globally, and versatile benefits associated with reach trucks are the key drivers of the reach trucks industry.
