<p>Do not overload a lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. The height of these industrial reach forklifts also raises a concern about having collisions into doorways or overhead objects. We supply rental forklifts for the Napa Valley wine industry every year. The load capacity of a pallet jack is arguably the most important factor to consider before buying.</p>

Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late.
