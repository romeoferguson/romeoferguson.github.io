An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.

Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>
