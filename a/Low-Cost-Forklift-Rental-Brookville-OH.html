<p>A warehouse forklift can also carry weight that your human warehouse staff simply can't. Commonly found on port loading docks, scrap yards and recycling plants, and within an endless variety of other industrial applications, there is one consistency among every rough terrain forklift: versatility. Each is designed to work within extreme environments, natural landscapes, and the uneven ground often found on construction sites.</p>
<p>They can weather any environment and derive fuel from multiple sources, but they do not have the unique capacities that reach forklifts do. After learning about each of these appliances and their uses, it is essential to sit down and reflect. This training is for workers who operate an industrial lift truck (classes 1, 4 or 5) in the workplace, commonly known as counterbalance forklift”.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work. One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition.
