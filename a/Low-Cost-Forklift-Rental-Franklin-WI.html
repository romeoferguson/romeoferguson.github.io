<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.

Our clients can avail from us a qualitative range of Hydraulic Pallet Truck. Lifted cars can be dangerous, especially if you're driving behind them. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts are most optimal for outdoor construction and surfaces with difficult terrain. Forklifts are powered by electric battery or combustion engines. Today, rough terrain forklifts are a common sight on construction projects. Another safety feature that an electric reach stacker offers is an emergency reversing device in the handle. A forklift is a type of powered industrial truck” covered by OSHA standards.</p>
<p>A lift kit can have a serious impact on your off-road driving. Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months. A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000.
