Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>

<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>

Whether working within the tight quarters of a semi trailer, stacking loads on the dock or handling put-away and retrieval within warehouse racks, the SC Series provides operators with the capability and confidence needed to position loads with precision.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
