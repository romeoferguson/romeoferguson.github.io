<h3>Forklift Industrial Hayward CA</h3>
<p>Sleep soundly knowing that your business is covered when you buy a new forklift, used forklift or rent a forklift from us. Outdoor forklifts use pneumatic tires with deep treads and more ground clearance to make them easier to drive on rough terrains. The operator stands in a sideways compartment and the side loader unloads objects on its side. When we start talking about lifting trucks, lift kits, etc.</p>
<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. Rentals often have service and repair costs built into that monthly payment. Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components.</p>
<p>Due to ineffective (or nonexistent) training, many forklift drivers aren't aware of max load capacities, or how to safely navigate their workspace with a heavy load. Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
