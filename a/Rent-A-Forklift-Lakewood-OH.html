<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>
<p>The company says its new products offer advances in efficiency technology with Toyota's optional Lift Logic Speed and Height Control System, enabling fast and easy picking. As one of the leading forklift companies in Melbourne and throughout Victoria, we can provide you with high-quality solutions for your particular project - whatever that might be. With a suspension lift, the wheels are pushed down from the frame and come in different varieties such as coil-spring bushings, leaf spring shackles of full-blown suspension kits.</p>

The most important part of choosing shocks for a lifted truck (besides knowing your truck's year, make, and model) is making sure you know the correct lift height. Linde offers a wide range of order picking equipment to suit all shelf heights, aisle widths, and order-picking methods.</p>
<p>Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. 27"W x 48"L forks feature entry rollers and tapered design for easy pallet and skid entry, and are reinforced for heavy duty loads.</p>
<p>The idea behind it is always the same: Every pallet truck from Linde should be able to be controlled effortlessly with only one hand. You want to be sure you're getting the right piece of machinery for your specific business that will offer years of service and a large return on your investment.

The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
