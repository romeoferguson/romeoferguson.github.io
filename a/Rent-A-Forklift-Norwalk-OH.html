Forklifts range in size depending on their function. A forklift is a mobile machine that uses two prongs, or forks, to lift and place loads into positions which are ordinarily difficult to reach.</p>

Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
