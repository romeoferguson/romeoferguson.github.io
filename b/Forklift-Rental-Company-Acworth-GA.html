To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
<p>Other narrow aisle trucks include stand up straddles, swing masts, side loaders, and turret trucks.
