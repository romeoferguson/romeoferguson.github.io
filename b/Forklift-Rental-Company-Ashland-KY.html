<p>BVA offers a wide range of industrial products to suit any industry including construction, mining, oil, forestry, foundation repair, MRO, OEMs and more. The dashboards of forklifts today use computers. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations.

Toyota's 7-series reach truck offers the industry's first AC Power System,along with Traction & Brake Control which gives improved traction, better braking and suspension control for more stability.
