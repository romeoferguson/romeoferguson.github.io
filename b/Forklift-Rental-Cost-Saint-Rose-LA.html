It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
