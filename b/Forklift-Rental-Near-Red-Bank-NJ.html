Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Popular types are high-lift fork truck, high-lift ram truck, high-lift boom truck, high-lift clamp truck, and high-lift platform truck (Fig. ATTACHMENT: A device other than conventional forks or load backrest extension, mounted permanently or removably on the elevating mechanism of a truck for handling the load.

For a full 25-foot (7.6 m) forward reach, the load capacity of this forklift is reduced to 2,000 pounds (908 kg) without outriggers, or stabilizing legs, and 3,250 pounds (148 kg) with outriggers.</p>

<p>Beyond the size and power source, when choosing a forklift you need to evaluate a variety of factors that impact your long-term cost, including how much and how high the machine can lift, how careful you need to be when manipulating the load in sensitive areas and whether you should buy or rent a forklift. The Multi-Task Control Handle allows operators to manage travel direction and speed while maneuvering during lift and reach operations.</p>

Diesel forklifts are strongly recommended if the forklift will be used for heavy lifting or outdoors. Load-reach management devices can automatically restrict the reach of the forklift based on the load being handled rather than relying on the operator.</p>
