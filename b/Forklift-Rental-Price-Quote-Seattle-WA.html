<p>Toyota's Double Reach Truck can help take you operations to new heights. If you need air compressors, filtration systems, or other high-end tools along with forklifts, Herc is likely the best place for you to start. With rich industry experience, we are presenting our clients an optimum quality range of Multi Function Hand Pallet Truck. Lifted trucks not only offer a unique appearance but also provide practical benefits, particularly for drivers who like to go off-road with their pickups and tackle serious trails.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

<p>Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. 27"W x 48"L forks feature entry rollers and tapered design for easy pallet and skid entry, and are reinforced for heavy duty loads.</p>
