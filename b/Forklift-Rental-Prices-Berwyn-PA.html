<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. The forklift's AC system features precise speed control, quickly adapts to varying conditions, and varies output for continued, consistent operation.

Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility. When you need to move materials, shift supplies, or store objects on a job site, a rough terrain forklift can do the job.</p>

They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front.

<h2>Lift Truck Companies Berwyn</h2>
<p>Many of these Custom and Lifted trucks are featured in some of the highest trim levels and many come standard with I6, V6 or V8 engines, meaning you just might get a lot more powertrain, torque and convenient technological amenities for your money; such features include front dual-zone climate control, front and rear parking sensors, adjustable pedals, a built-in navigation system or a HomeLink Universal Garage Door Opener.</p>
<p>Be sure the load is centered and the forks are completely under the load before lifting. Use these machines to tackle residential or commercial landscaping jobs. 2. Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners. Compare that to any other body style of any car or truck from the ‘90s and it looks outdated and ugly.</p>
<p>When driving rough terrain forklifts, safety should always come first. Employers who fail to have their workers properly trained and licensed to operate forklifts in the workplace expose themselves to expensive OSHA fines and severe penalties. Also, the use of technologically well-versed forklift trucks in this region is gaining maximum traction and supplementing the growth of the truck industry.</p>
