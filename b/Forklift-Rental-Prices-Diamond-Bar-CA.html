Better ground clearance than Pneumatic Tire forklift. Let our sales representatives know exactly what the application is and we will help you determine what type of forklifts are best. You'll now be able to see further down the road and over other vehicles. The conditions on site at construction, mining, forestry, and similar jobs are too tough for ordinary forklifts.</p>
<p>Reliable and easy-to-use, our all-terrain forklifts for hire provide great performance for your workplace. The first reason is obvious Sun Equipment does not want you to purchase the wrong used forklift for sale or spend more than you need on a used forklift with features that you will never use.

<p>For all your outdoor material handling needs, we have Hyster forklifts including high capacity big trucks that are great for the lumber industry, container handlers for any storage yard, and other gas powered forklifts to meet the needs of any heavy duty job. When renting forklifts these points will help ensure your rental experience is safe, cost effective, and gets the job done.</p>
<p>When driving rough terrain forklifts, safety should always come first. Employers who fail to have their workers properly trained and licensed to operate forklifts in the workplace expose themselves to expensive OSHA fines and severe penalties. Also, the use of technologically well-versed forklift trucks in this region is gaining maximum traction and supplementing the growth of the truck industry.</p>
<p>A team of our qualified professionals, with a wide experience manufacture the provided pallet trucks using quality approved raw material and modish technology. Although your crew members should take extra precautions for extreme weather, these machines can handle muddy, icy, and snowy terrain. Having an order picker licence and forklift licence combined is a huge advantage when looking for work in the warehouse industry.</p>

No matter your application or your warehousing needs, we're sure to have a forklift truck that meets your requirements. Exclusive, spin-off hubs allow the outer tires to be removed to drive the machine through a standard door opening.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Today's leaders, especially Toyota and KION, continue to expand their reach beyond industrial trucks and into the broader market for supply chain services. As a forklift operator, you don't have to worry about the load center as long as you respect the listed weight capacity and keep the load balanced. There are various hand pallet trucks such as electric hand pallet trucks and hydraulic hand pallet trucks to suit your warehouse needs.</p>
