<h3>Difference Between Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks in North Weymouth MA 02191</h3>
<p>Like the LHM230P, the BT Pro Lifter, LHT100 is designed to work with minimal starting force for increased productivity during horizontal transport and loading operations. However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>This decreased load center is specified, recognizing that loads may be handled which have a higher density and therefore, shorter load center than the truck rating.
