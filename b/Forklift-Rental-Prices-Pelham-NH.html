<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 30 feet in the air. Backed by our proven support network, Crown's internal combustion forklifts are ready to handle the tough assignments. Our exclusive lifted models make these professional-grade trucks even more impressive and capable.</p>
<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV. Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>

<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>

<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>Whether you're looking to buy a new forklift, rent compact construction equipment, or service an existing machine, everything we do is rooted in the highest quality. But a truck with 31" tires just will not go anywhere unless it is paved and suitable for cars. When driving around in a lifted Jeep Wrangler, you are in control of a highly capable truck. Whether you're looking for bigger tires to help blast through inclement weather in Stephenville, or increase ground clearance for off-roading adventures, upfitted trucks add versatility and performance, all while looking great.</p>

Give us a call at 800-836-3882 if you have any questions or are interested in learning additional information about these trucks. Not all kits are created equal, and a rough-riding rig can add to fatigue on long trips, make controlling the vehicle exhausting, and put wear on the truck itself.</p>

<p>Similar to standard counterbalanced forklifts, NA and VNA lifts can support from 3,000 to 12,000 lbs and are available in a range of three or four-stage masts that offer lift heights up to 31 feet, as well as multiple chassis designs. Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>Forklifts weigh thousands of lbs. For true off-road operations requiring superior traction, there are also four-wheel drive rough-terrain forklifts. From a higher center of gravity to reduced visibility in close quarters, a lifted truck or SUV certainly comes with additional roadway safety challenges. While a dealership may not seem like the obvious choice to install your vehicle's lift kit, Currie's years of rigorous training, certification and experience in lift kit installation has made them the go-to experts in suspension enhancement.</p>

It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
