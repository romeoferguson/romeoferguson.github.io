<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>We are one of the most reliable supplier of heavy equipments like forklifts, cranes, earth moving and other material handling equipments. Rated capacity reduced for load centers greater than 24 in. and lift heights greater than 13 ft.
