We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona. This course covers how to safely and efficiently operate a rough terrain forklift, how to educate and evaluate other operators on their rough terrain forklift performance, identifying when and how to service and maintain forklifts and how to keep other workers around the forklift area safe.</p>

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>

The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process.
