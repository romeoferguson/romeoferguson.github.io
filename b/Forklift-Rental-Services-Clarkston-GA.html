<p>But with lift kits, the danger is a little different. Towering over most other folks on the road also provides a greater view into the distance, which is a plus when driving on regular roads and when off-roading. Airide air bag suspension springs are manufactured by Firestone for heavy truck, trailer and bus for applications such as steering axle, seat, cab mount, drive axle, lift axle, and primary trailer air suspension.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
