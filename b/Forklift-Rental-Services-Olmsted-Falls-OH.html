<p>The walk-behind pallet stacker is basically a forklift with a mast, operating on battery power. Many forklifts have an automatic alarm that will sound when you travel in reverse. Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands. The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>

<p>Suspension lifts are also found on a number of high performance sports cars, in which a very low ground clearance is used to improve handling, using an aerodynamic effect known as downforce; examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Huracan, McLaren 720S, and the second generation Ford GT. Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship.

<p>These types of kits suspend the frame, body, engine, and the powertrain all above the wheels.
