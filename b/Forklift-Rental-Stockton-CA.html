One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks. They also invest heavily in the design of their machines to ensure optimal performance even on jobsites that include limited access terrain and high-reach areas.

When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials.
