<p>While the machine is designed to work on rough terrain, it isn't always set to work on all types of terrain. When you rent a forklift from Gregory Poole Lift Systems, you get the adaptability you need from your forklift fleet, without a huge impact on your bottom line. Many lifted truck owners purchased standard vehicles and later make modifications to them, either by themselves or with the help of a mechanic.</p>
