<p>This system is a result of the various types of forklift training available. In addition, the use of a powered industrial truck in a location for which that type of powered industrial truck is not designated for use, for example due to a flammable atmosphere, can result in a fire or explosion. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>
<p>These trucks are designed to lift the operator to retrieve items. Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight. If other tests of tests for trucks over 20,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties.
