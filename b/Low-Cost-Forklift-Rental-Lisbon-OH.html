An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>

Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
