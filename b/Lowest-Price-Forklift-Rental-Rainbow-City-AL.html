<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>If you're ready to experience what a lifted truck can do for you, stop by and see the team at Nations Trucks today. Rentals are also useful to those who experience increased workload on a seasonal basis. Forklifts have come a long way since 1906, when an official of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Altoona, Pa., added storage battery power to a baggage wagon, producing what was probably the first powered platform truck.</p>

<h2>Used Reach Truck Rainbow City</h2>
<p>The standard lift kit raises your truck higher off the ground with affecting how it handles. Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Unfortunately for those who want the Rocky Ridge bumpers on their Jeep but don't necessarily care about the rest of the lift kit, they are not available as a separate option.</p>
<p>The first thing when it comes to owning lifted trucks is to understand how you'd like to spend your money. Full Free Lift = A truck where the fork carriage travels to the top of the inner mast before the inner mast begins to rise. Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>
