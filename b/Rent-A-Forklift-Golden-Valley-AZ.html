<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

Another subtype of warehouse forklift, the counterbalance forklift, looks like a standard warehouse forklift—except it has no extending arms for the forward forks and the back is weighted to counterbalance the load.

Accelerate your distribution and reduce unnecessary handling time with electric powered order picking equipment.</p>

Our team of engineers developed our EWRS-RTF series of jcb rough terrain forklift tires to be easily repaired if damaged, although we are not sure you will need to with the quality that went into our design and components. You should be able to discuss the operational parts of the rough terrain lift, the center of gravity (lift and load) and stability characteristics (pyramid).</p>
